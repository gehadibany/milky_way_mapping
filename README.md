# ARROW Project

This repository contains data analysis code and datasets for the ARROW project, which appears to be related to radio astronomy, specifically analyzing spectral data, mapping spiral arms, and calculating rotation curves.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

*   **`data/`**: Contains all data files, including CSVs, ZIP archives, and text files.
*   **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for processing and analyzing the data.

## Notebooks

Here is a brief description of the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory:

*   **`ARROW_Codes.ipynb`**: Contains utility functions for Doppler effect calculations (`f2v`) and beam width/resolution calculations.
*   **`ARROW_Processing.ipynb`**: Processes ARROW spectrum data. It reads raw data files, subtracts background spectra (referenced as `NEP1.csv` to `NEP10.csv`), and calculates radial velocities.
*   **`ARROW_Processing_NGP.ipynb`**: Similar to `ARROW_Processing.ipynb` but likely for the North Galactic Pole (NGP), referencing background files `NGP1.csv` to `NGP10.csv`.
*   **`Archive.ipynb`**: Analyzes archived spectral data (`Archive_Spectra.csv`).
*   **`Arrow_Data_Display.ipynb`**: Displays ARROW data and background spectra.
*   **`Mapping_Spiral_Arms.ipynb`**: Focuses on mapping spiral arms using velocity data (`mapfinal.csv`).
*   **`Maximum_velocity_measured.ipynb`**: Allows users to input a filename and likely calculates or displays maximum velocity measured.
*   **`Rotation_Curve.ipynb`**: Calculates and plots the rotation curve of the galaxy using `lsrnew.csv`.
*   **`TMA.ipynb`**: Contains some plotting code, possibly for Time-Motion Analysis or similar.

## Data Files

The `data/` directory contains various datasets:

*   **`LSR_corrected_velocities.csv`**: Velocity data corrected for the Local Standard of Rest.
*   **`Raw_Data.zip`**: Archive containing raw CSV data files for specific longitudes and latitudes.
*   **`Velocities.zip`**: Archive containing velocity data files.
*   **`lsr.csv`, `lsrnew.csv`**: Data related to the Local Standard of Rest.
*   **`map.csv`, `mapmix.csv`, `mapnew.csv`**: Data files used for mapping.
*   **`rotationdata.csv`**: Data for rotation curve calculations.
*   **`Stellarium`, `Stellarium.txt`**: Text files, possibly containing coordinates or data exported from Stellarium software.

## Usage

To use the notebooks, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `astropy`, `bokeh`, `matplotlib`).

When running the notebooks, if prompted for a filename, provide the name of the file located in the `data/` directory (e.g., `l 96 near NEP` for `l 96 near NEP.csv`). The notebooks have been configured to look for files in the `../data/` directory.

**Note**: Some data files referenced in the notebooks (e.g., `NEP1.csv`...`NEP10.csv`, `NGP1.csv`...`NGP10.csv`, `mapfinal.csv`, `Archive_Spectra.csv`) are not present in the root of the repository. They might be generated by other steps or are expected to be provided by the user. `Raw_Data.zip` and `Velocities.zip` contain potentially relevant data files.
