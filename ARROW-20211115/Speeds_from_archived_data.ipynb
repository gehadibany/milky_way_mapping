    "#  Activity 6.2 - Plotting and measuring speeds from archive spectra\n",

    "This is similar to Activity 5.1 Displaying your own data and Activity 5.4 Measuring speeds from your own data - except that in this case the dataset contains multiple columns of spectral data from several Galactic longitudes.\n",

    "You therefore have to loop through the data selecting, displaying and measuring for each data column (Galactic longitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use _Bokeh_ to display the data as this will avoid a number of technical issues that would arise if you use _Matpltlib_. Section 5 of the UsingBokeh notebook covers everything you need to know.\n",

    "In essence you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the provided archived data (suggest you use Pandas)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cycle through the Galactic longitude spectrum columns and use Bokeh to display them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify the position (and error) of V_obs_max and record these values. Don't forget to note which longitude values you are recording.\n",
    "\n",
