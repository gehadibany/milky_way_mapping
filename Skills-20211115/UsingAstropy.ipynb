    "1. **`units`** which allows quick and accurate specification and conversion between scientific units. \n",
    "2. **`constants`** which gives acces to a huge number of physics and engineering constants. \n",
    "3. **`coordinates`** which facilitates transfer from one astronomical coordinate system to another - we'll look at converting between Galactic and Celestial coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "As always, we start off by importing the modules and packages. In this case we'll import the entire `astropy.units` and `astropy.constants` modules. However, we'll only import the 3 classes we actually need from the `astropy.coordinates` module, and a single class from `astropy.time`."
