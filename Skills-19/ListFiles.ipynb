    "Version 0.1 Dec 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the  `os` and `glob` modules to find and list files located in different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `os` module covers a wide range of low-level operating system functions, such as finding files and directories, creating and deleting files and directories, working with environment variables.  Some of these should be used with care !   Here we will be concerned only with the functions relating to finding and listing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `glob` module is far more focused in scope, concentrating on finding and listing files.  It does this in an operating sytem independent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these modules are part of the Python standard library, so can be used without any additional installation or setup. They just need to be imported in the usual way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further information, refer to the Python documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html\n",

    "### 1. Listing files with `os`\n",
    "\n",
    "To simply list the contents of a folder or directory, `os.listdir()` is the quickest and easiest way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will list all of the files in the folder specified by the pathname. In Windows, pathnames start with a drive letter. Macintosh pathnames work in a similar way, but without the drive letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "One quirk of Python is that the backslash character ' \\\\ ' , which is used in Windows as part of a pathname, has a special meaning (it is used as an escape character), and so can't be included in a pathname.  To specify a Windows pathname in Python, use the forward slash character ' / ' instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that you have a folder `C:\\OU\\SXPS288` set up to hold all of your work on SXPS288, and within that you have a folder structure for the different investigations, including a folder `C:\\OU\\SXPS288\\DataFiles\\ReferenceSpectra` containing some spectra files that you have downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "(On a Macintosh, the corresponding pathname might be something like: `Users\\yourname\\OU\\SXPS288\\DataFiles\\ReferenceSpectra`)"

    "\n",
    "While `os.listdir()` is quick and easy, it is also indiscriminate.  As you may have found, it simply lists all of the files in the location specified by the pathname.  If you have a mixture of different files or a large number of files, you may wish to search for a specific subset or group of files (for instance, to list only the .csv files).  \n",
