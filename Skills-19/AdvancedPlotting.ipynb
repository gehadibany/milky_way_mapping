    "## 1 Histograms\n",
    "A histogram displays data as a series of vertical or horizontal columns.  This format is commonly used where continuous measurements are grouped together into numerical ranges, or _bins_.  An example would be the counts in the Compton experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are closely related to _bar charts_.  The main difference is that bar charts can be used to represent _categorical data_ where the values are grouped according to some other criterion (such comparing sales of different types of product).   In Matplotlib, these types of chart are produced using `pyplot.hist()` and `pyplot.bar()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Simple histogram\n",
    "In this first example, we will create a histogram to represent a dataset that could be counts in an x-ray experiment.  We'll first create an array containing some data using numpy, and then use `pyplot.hist()` to generate the histogram.  `pyplot.hist()` divides the range into the specified number of bins, counts up the number of values in each bin and plots these as vertical bars.\n",
