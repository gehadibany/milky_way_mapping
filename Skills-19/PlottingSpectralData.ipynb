    "\n",
    "To start with, let's use `glob` to make a list of all the NIST spectra files in the chosen folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, pathnames start with a drive letter. Macintosh pathnames work in a similar way, but without the drive letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "One quirk of Python is that the backslash character ' \\\\ ' , which is used in Windows as part of a pathname, has a special meaning (it is used as an escape character), and so can't be included in a pathname.  To specify a Windows pathname in Python, use the forward slash character ' / ' instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example supposes that you have a folder `C:\\OU\\SXPS288` set up to hold all of your work on SXPS288, and within that you have a folder structure for the different investigations, including a folder `C:\\OU\\SXPS288\\DataFiles\\ReferenceSpectra` containing some spectra files that you have downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "(On a Macintosh, the corresponding pathname might be something like: `Users\\yourname\\OU\\SXPS288\\DataFiles\\ReferenceSpectra`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectra files end with `.jdx` so we can select only those files by specifying this part of the search string.  `glob` is the best choice to do this, since it allows you to specify a wildcard search string as part of the pathname."

For each file in this list, the function `GetHeaderData()` reads the file and builds a list containing relevant information, such as the number of header lines, the title, the full filename, and the y axis label.  This list is returned and added to the dictionary, with the substance name as the key.  \n",
