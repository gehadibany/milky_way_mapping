The examples we'll cover demonstrate just a few of the powerful features. After reviewing this material you might like to compare it with the `UsingBokeh` notebook.\n",

Every time we call the **`subplot()`** function we create a new a `matplotlib` `axes` object and define a new context for `matplotlib` to focus on. All of these `axes` objects are contained within another type of object - a `matplotlib` `figure`. Fine-grained control of subplot can be achieved by addressing the `figure` and `axes` objects directly. This is beyond the scope of this notebook but details can be found in the `matplotlib` documentation. A good place to start might be the Subplots demo:\n",

    "\n",
    "The main thing to notice for this example is the **`plt.subplot()`** function, which is often used with three arguments i.e. **`plt.subplot(nrows, ncols, index)`**. The first two arguments arguments specify that the enclosing `figure` is implicitly divided into a grid with **`nrows`** rows and **`ncols`** columns. The **`index`** argument defines which cell of the implicit grid corresponds to the location of the subplot we are defining. Positions are defined by an integer value starting with `1` in the top left corner and increasing to the right and downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see we've set the limits for the y axis to between 0 and 220 by using the line **`plt.ylim(0,220)`**. Otherwise the autoscalling would make all graphs look pretty similar.\n",

    "The **`plt.suptitle()`** function defines an overall title for the figure containing the subplots.\n",
